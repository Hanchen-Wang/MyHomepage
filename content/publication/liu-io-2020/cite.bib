 abstract = {Furthest Neighbor search in high-dimensional space has been widely used in many applications such as recommendation systems. Because of the “curse of dimensionality” problem, c-approximate furthest neighbor (C-AFN) is a substitute as a trade-off between result accuracy and efficiency. However, most of the current techniques for external memory are only suitable for low-dimensional space.},
