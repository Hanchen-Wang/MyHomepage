I am currently an ARC DECRA Fellow and lecturer at [Australian Artificial Intelligence Institute (AAII)](https://www.uts.edu.au/research/australian-artificial-intelligence-institute), [University of Technology Sydney](https://www.uts.edu.au/). I am also an Adjunct Lecturer at [The University of New South Wales](https://unsw.edu.au/) and an Associate Investigator of [ARC Centre of Excellence for the Mathematical Analysis of Cellular Systems (MACSYS)](https://macsys.org/). Before joining UTS, I was a postdoctoral research fellow at [Data and Knowledge Research Group](https://unswdb.github.io/) at [The University of New South Wales](https://unsw.edu.au/), supervised by Prof. [Wenjie Zhang](https://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~zhangw/) and a postdoctoral research fellow at Australian Artificial Intellegence Institution (AAII), University of Technology Sydney, supervised by Prof.[Lu Qin](https://www.uts.edu.au/staff/lu.qin). I obtained my Ph.D. degree in Computer Science from the University of Technology Sydney in November 2021, advised by Prof.[Ying Zhang](http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~yingz/) and Prof.[Lu Qin](https://www.uts.edu.au/staff/lu.qin). I received my bachelor's degree in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics from [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/) in July 2016.

My research focuses on developing machine learning algorithms for graph structured data, database systems, and scientific discovery, including developing graph neural network architectures, applying machine learning techniques to improve the algorithms in the database domain, and AI for Science.
